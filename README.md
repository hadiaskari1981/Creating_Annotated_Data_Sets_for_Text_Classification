# Creating_Annotated_Data_Sets_for_Text_Classification
The acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent or a physical experiment .
The cost associated with the labeling process thus may render a fully labeled training set infeasible, whereas acquisition
of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive. In such situations, semi-supervised learning can be of great practical value. However, here I
am trying to find a solution to annotate text automatically using the concepts of social science which is a geart interest in machine
learning and it definetely shoots up the accuracy of training in text classification. 


Here Hadi is writing, it is my Thesis as a M.Sc. student in Data Analytics in Rennes School of Business, so the code is under construction .
